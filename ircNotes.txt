 Start

1. Initialize the server
   - Create a socket
     - AF_INET: Use IPv4 addresses
     - SOCK_STREAM: Use TCP protocol
   - Bind the socket to a specific IP address and port
     - Set the socket address structure (sockaddr_in) with IP address and port number
   - Listen for incoming connections on the socket
     - Set the socket to the listening state

2. Accept client connections
   - Accept incoming connection requests
     - Block until a client connection is established
     - Accept the connection, creating a new socket for communication with the client
   - Create a new thread/process for each client
     - Spawn a new thread/process to handle the communication with the client
     - Pass the newly created socket to the thread/process

3. Handle client requests
   - Receive data from the client
     - Receive data from the client socket
   - Parse the received data
     - Parse the received data to identify the type of request
     - Extract relevant information from the request
   - Determine the type of request (JOIN, PRIVMSG, etc.)
     - Identify the command or action requested by the client

4. Process client requests
   - Implement the logic for each request type
     - Handle different commands such as JOIN, PRIVMSG, etc.
     - Update the server state and client states as necessary
   - Respond to client requests accordingly
     - Prepare a response message based on the request type and server/client state
     - Send the response message back to the client

5. Broadcast messages
   - Send messages to all connected clients
     - Iterate through all connected clients
     - Send the message to each client's socket
   - Update client states with the received messages
     - Store the received messages in each client's message history or buffer

6. Handle client disconnections
   - Detect client disconnection
     - Check if the client socket is closed or an error occurs during communication
   - Remove the client from the active client list
     - Clean up any resources associated with the client
     - Remove the client from the list of connected clients

7. Handle server shutdown
   - Listen for termination signals or commands
     - Continuously check for termination signals or commands
   - Gracefully shut down the server
     - Close the listening socket to stop accepting new connections
     - Close all client connections and release associated resources
